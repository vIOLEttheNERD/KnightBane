# Knightbane

**Knightbane** is a AAA Hack and Slash Action RPG currently in development by **Bouph Studios**, a game development division under **Lazarelle Holdings**. The game follows *Atlas*, a solitary knight navigating the shifting depths of **Ozarink City** — a mysterious, lore-rich setting full of conflict, forgotten magic, and emerging chaos.

## 🕹️ Game Overview

* **Title:** Knightbane
* **Genre:** Hack and Slash / Action RPG
* **Engine:** Godot Engine
* **Platform(s):** PC (with possible future console support planned)
* **Gameplay Focus:** Fluid melee combat, character progression, atmospheric storytelling
* **Setting:** Ozarink City

Knightbane unfolds in the sprawling, fractured megacity of Ozarink — a port-city turned decaying titan of industry, where medieval relics and futuristic sprawl collide. Once a beacon of trade and power, Ozarink now struggles under the weight of its own forgotten greatness, with rooftop communities, underground sewer networks, and massive infrastructure stitched together by time and desperation.

You play as Atlas, a wandering knight awakened into this chaotic new era, navigating vibrant marketplaces, derelict towers, and myth-laced trainlines to unravel the city's ancient truths. From garden sanctuaries tied to your skill progression, to nighttime skirmishes across moving subway cars and shadowy back-alleys, the city becomes your battleground and your mystery.

What begins as survival grows into something deeper — a reckoning with the past, a confrontation with the present, and a climb toward power that may reshape Ozarink forever.
